## To Build
1. Make sure you installed CMake, g++, and commom library and build utils. It was testd on Ubuntu.
2. Run the following commands on Linux console: 
   $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug CMakeLists.txt
   $ make
## To Run
$ ./test

** Notes **
1. It is work in progress.
2. It took me already 4 hours to get here. This is the best I can do with 4 hours.
3. I have not had time working on the details of generating calls with uniformly distributed and other requirements.
4. I need more time to work on the Dispatching logic.

Overall:
1. A double ended queue for the call requests.
2. One worker thread works on the the queue to dispatch calls to elevators.
3. An API for producing calls.
4. Elevator, Call Elevator, and Dispatcher classes were defined to represent the objects in the test.
5. Simulator class is a utility class for Part B, it is dummy right now.
6. A testing program for basic unit and flow test, to make sure it builds and runs.
